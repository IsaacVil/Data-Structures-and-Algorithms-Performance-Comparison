# Data Structures and Algorithms Performance Comparison

## About the Project  
This project is meant to be test with an Costa Rica's electoral roll is in disarray because the trees work best with disarray data.  
The **Data Structures and Algorithms Performance Comparison** project is designed to analyze and compare the performance of various **data structures** and **algorithms** through real-world applications. This project uses the **Costa Rican Electoral Registry** as a dataset to perform operations like searching for a citizen ID (cedula), deleting records, listing all records, and loading data.  
  
In this project, we implement and compare different data structures, including:
- **Linked List**
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
- **AVL Tree**
- **B-tree**

The goal is to demonstrate how each data structure handles these operations, and to compare their **performance** by measuring the **execution time** for each operation.  
  
This project was a collaborative effort between **Isaac Villalobos** and **Kevin Vega**, demonstrating our understanding of both cryptographic principles and data structures in the context of real-world applications.  
Any questions or inquiries about the inner workings of the project can be directed to my personal email: IsaacVillalobosB@gmail.com.  

## Features
- **Dataset**: The Costa Rican electoral registry (Padrón Electoral) is loaded and used to perform various operations.
- **Operations**:
  - **Search by Citizen ID**: Search for a specific citizen ID (cedula) in the dataset.
  - **Delete a Record**: Remove a record based on the citizen ID.
  - **List All Records**: Display all records in the dataset.
  - **Load All Records**: Load the entire dataset into memory for further operations.
- **Data Structures Comparison**:
  - **Linked List**: A simple linear data structure.
  - **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A tree-based structure that maintains order for efficient searching.
  - **AVL Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree for faster search times.
  - **B-tree**: A tree structure optimized for disk-based storage, commonly used in databases.
- **Performance Benchmarking**:
  - **Execution Time Measurement**: The time taken by each data structure to complete operations (search, delete, list, load) is recorded.
  - **Comparison of Times**: The execution times of each data structure are compared to assess their efficiency in performing the same tasks.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: C++  
- **Data Structures**: Linked Lists, Binary Search Tree (BST), AVL Tree, B-tree  
- **Benchmarking**: Performance measurement using time tracking for each operation  
- **Dataset**: Costa Rican Electoral Registry (Padrón Electoral)  
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio 2022  
- **Version Control**: GitHub  

## Installation and Usage
1) Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/IsaacVil/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Performance-Comparison.git 
2) Put your disarray Electoral Registry in the folder with the file .exe.
3) Open the project in your preferred **C++ IDE or compiler**.  
4) Compile the project following the instructions in the source files or provided documentation.  
5) Run the executable to start the program.

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, We:  
- Implemented various **data structures** like linked lists, binary search trees, AVL trees, and B-trees for real-world use cases.  
- Analyzed and compared the **performance** of these data structures, focusing on **execution time** for operations like search, delete, and list all records.  
- Gained hands-on experience with real-world data and applied theoretical knowledge of data structures to practical scenarios.  
- Enhanced my ability to choose the most appropriate data structure based on both **performance** and **complexity** requirements.

## Acknowledgments
- We would like to thank my **professor and classmates** at the **Technological Institute of Costa Rica (TEC)** for their guidance and feedback throughout the development of this project.
